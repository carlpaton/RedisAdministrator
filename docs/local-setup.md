## Deploy Docker Registry
This deploys to https://hub.docker.com/

I last did this with an integration from Github to Docker.com but they have since canned this feature and put it behind a paywall, I'll update here after I figure out how to do it.

```
wip high level steps will be

build docker image locally
tag image
login to docker.com registry, however that works
push image
hope it works
```
